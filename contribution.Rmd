# Contributing Guidelines

**Thank you for considering to help out!**

QDECR started as a side project to make QDEC and mri_glmfit more accessible to members of our department. The desire for additional features kept growing, and so we decided to reprogram everything in R. Over time we have developed QDECR to fit our specific needs, but those may differ from what you - the user - may need. We therefore decided to make QDECR accessible early on, so that it can become a community-driven project.
