# 1.1 Requirements

In order to run QDECR you need to have several things ready:

* A Unix system.
* [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) installed.
* [R](https://www.r-project.org) installed.
* Your images processed through Freesurfer with the `-qcache` flag.

For the sake of the vignette we will assume that you have done all these.

In R you first need to install the QDECR package:
```{r eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
# Install the devtools package
if (!requireNamespace("devtools"))
  install.packages('devtools')

# Download and install QDECR from Github
devtools::install_github("slamballais/QDECR")

# Attach the package
library(QDECR)

```

And that's it. You are ready to use QDECR.

# 1.2 Setting your parameters

Here I discuss how to figure out whether your global variables are set correctly and what you need to have prepared in order to actually run QDECR.
