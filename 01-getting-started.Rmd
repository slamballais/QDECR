# 1.1 What is `QDECR`?

`QDECR` is a tool that can be used to perform surface-based vertex-wise analyses in `R`. 

---

# 1.2 Requirements

In order to run `QDECR` you need to have several things ready:

* A Unix system.
* [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) installed.
* [`R`](https://www.r-project.org) installed.
* Your images processed through Freesurfer with the `-qcache` flag.

To install Freesurfer, [follow this tutorial](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32530340/freesurfer-installed-on-ubuntu), but change the `wget` command to the most up-to-date version of Freesurfer (*the tutorial downloads Freesurfer 5.3.0 which is NOT the newest version*).

To install R on Ubuntu 18.04, [follow this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-r-on-ubuntu-18-04) and [run step 1 of this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-r-packages-using-devtools-on-ubuntu-18-04).

For the sake of the vignette we will assume that you have done all these.

In R you first need to install the QDECR package:
```{r eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE}
# Install the devtools package
if (!requireNamespace("devtools"))
  install.packages('devtools')

# Download and install QDECR from Github
devtools::install_github("slamballais/QDECR")

# Attach the package
library(QDECR)

```

And that's it. You are ready to use `QDECR`.

# 1.3 Setting your parameters

Here I discuss how to figure out whether your global variables are set correctly and what you need to have prepared in order to actually run `QDECR`.
