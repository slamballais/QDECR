Version 0.7.0 is the first version that is publically released. It is also the version that was presented at OHBM 2019 and was thus named "OHBM". As we do not have any formal news for versions before 0.7.0, we will keep it brief.

## New functions and features

* Creation of the QDECR package (before 0.7.0 it was a series of associated scripts)
* Creation of the vw object and associated functions
* Handling of imputed datasets (via imp2list)
* Creation of all summary and plot functions
* Creation of the `stack` concept
