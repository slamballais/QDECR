# Disclaimer

**THIS PACKAGE IS STILL BEING DEVELOPED!** 
It currently can run vertex-wise linear regression (OHBM 2019). We are working on vertex-wise linear mixed models (OHBM 2020). 

# About 

QDECR is an R package to perform vertex-wise analyses on cortical surface maps. It is an attempt to enrich vertex-wise analyses with features commonly found in R, such as easy design matrix creation, using multiply imputed datasets, handling complex formulas, etc. Users familiar with R will immediately notice that the package works similar to most other statistical models in R. 

We are currently at version 0.8.4 (Momo).
