# Before you get started

Here I will discuss some of the things you can do one the analysis is done.

---

# Saving/loading projects

Any analyses that are run with e.g. `qdecr_fastlm` are automatically stored as files on disk. 

To load the project back into R, you can use the `qdecr_load` function:

`vw <- qdecr_load("path/to/project")`

It is also possible to reload the vertex-wise data:

`vw <- reload(vw)`

Do note that this will generate huge temporary files in your `dir_tmp`, so be mindful to remove those afterwards!
