# 3.1 Before you get started

Here I will discuss some of the research-related things that you need to ask yourself before you can actually get started. I will also refer to some R information.

# 3.1 General features of `QDECR`

`R` is a programming language with extensive functionality related to statistical analyses. `QDECR` is written to capitalize on some of this functionality, including:

* Working with imputed missing data
* Straightforward formula definition
* Usage of interaction terms, splines, polynomial terms, etc.
* `AsIs` ('as is') treatment of data within formulas, i.e. being able to manipulate the data while specifying the formula

All these features can be found in `QDECR`.

The core `qdecr` function follows a number of steps:

1. Checking the input arguments
2. Preparing the statistical model
3. Loading the vertex-wise data
4. Running the statistical model per vertex
5. Applying any corrections over the surface
6. Saving out all the statistics

# 3.2 QDECR features

## 3.2.1 Vertex-wise data

Within `QDECR` all vertex measures that Freesurfer calculates have default names. This is `qdecr_` combined with the name of the vertex measure file. A comprehensive list:

* qdecr_thickness
* qdecr_area
* qdecr_area.pial
* qdecr_curv
* qdecr_jacobian_white
* qdecr_pial
* qdecr_sulc
* qdecr_volume
* qdecr_white.H
* qdecr_white.k

Note that qdecr_w-g.pct does not work yet.

## 3.2.2 Formulas

### 3.2.2.1 On formulas

Nearly all statistical model functions in `R` utilize `formula` objects. The `formula` object allows users to generate design matrices for subsequent analysis through straightforward syntax:

`Y ~ a + b`

Lets deconstruct this:

* `Y`: The outcome (AKA dependent variable AKA label)
* `~`: Denotes the left-hand side versus the right-hand side of the formula
* `a + b`: The additive effect of determinants `a` and `b` (AKA independent variables AKA features)

This format allows users to use simple pseudo-math to generate complicated design matrices. `R` handles design making for incomplete data, conversion of categorical variables to e.g. dummy variables, etc.

### 3.2.2.2 Using formulas in `QDECR`

`QDECR` uses the `formula` object to allow users to easily create design matrices. It further extends this functionality by explicitly including the vertex measure as a variable in the formula:

* Cortical thickness as outcome: `qdecr_thickness ~ a + b`

### 3.2.2.3 Interaction terms, splines, polynomials, `AsIs` treatment, etc. in `QDECR`

`R` also allows users to apply more complicated formulas:

* Interaction terms: `Y ~ a:b`
* Main effects and interaction: `Y ~ a * b` [equivalent to `Y ~ a + b + a:b`]
* Polynomials: `Y ~ a + poly(b, 2, raw = TRUE)` [equivalent to `Y ~ a + b + b^2`]
* Orthogonal polynomials: `Y ~ a + poly(b, 2)`
* Splines (e.g. from the `splines` package): `Y ~ bs(a, 3)`

Furthermore, `R` features `AsIs` treatment of objects, meaning that variables can be manipulated within the `formula` object itself using `I()`. This allows users to do all kinds of things in the formula itself, including:

* Quadratic terms: `Y ~ a + I(a^2)`
* Standardizing a variable: `Y ~ I(scale(a))`
* Combining variables: `Y ~ I(a + 2*b)`

By extension, `QDECR` has all these features.
